    "q": "How does GetSetGo online coaching work?",
    "a": "We are a dedicated online platform for fitness coaching. Once you sign up for a one-on-one coaching program with us, your coach gets on a call with you to understand your lifestyle, physical stats, goals, constraints and aspirations. Based on the data and information that your coach collects, a customised nutrition and exercise program is created for you. Every week hence, the coach would schedule a particular day on which he would take updates from you to understand your progress and suggest changes, if necessary."

    "q": "How much weight can I lose with your program?",
    "a": "Exact weight loss cannot be predicted as there are a lot of factors that determine the rate of progress. Parameters like adherence, stress, sleep, training experience and intensity, hormonal differences make it difficult to predict the exact progress. Having said that, your coach aims to make you lose approximately 1-1.5% weight every week, however different individuals might have a different response mechanism."

    "q": "Do you work with people who have medical conditions like thyroid, PCOS, diabetes, etc?",
    "a": "Yes, we work with them to help them lose fat or in general improve their lifestyle and relationship with food. We do not claim to reverse their health condition as we are not medical experts. Having said that, most clients have seen positive results because of the lifestyle change."
